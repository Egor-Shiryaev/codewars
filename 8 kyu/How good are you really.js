// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return True if you're better, else False!


function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
    // Your code here
  }


  console.log(function betterThanAverage([12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 90], 9));
